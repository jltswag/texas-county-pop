OOP Fall 21 Assignment - Uses arrays and scanners to analyze a text file containing the populations and names of 254 counties using 5 methods.

The Population1 Class performs five different methods on the "TexasCountyPopulation.txt" file and works mainly off the BlueJ terminal. The population method reads through the file using a scanner and prints out the statistics for each county line-by-line to the terminal. The findTotal method finds the total population of all the Texas counties combined and outputs the result to the terminal. The randomCounty method outputs randomly outputs the name and population of one of the 254 counties. The digitCounty method looks for counties with a user-given leading digit between 1-9, and outputs the name and populations of the fitting counties to the terminal. The analysis method draws a bar graph of the amount of counties with the population of a leading digit 1-9 and graphs the statistic for each number.

The Start class creates a Population1 object.
